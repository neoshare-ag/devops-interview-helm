# devops-interview-helm

A fellow DevOps comes to you to get some help with his task to build a new helm-chart. He create a new chart with the helm cli.

The chart is supposed to deploy a simple NGINX server as deployment in a kubernetes cluster.

- Fix this helm chart as I cannot template it. You can `helm template .` to debug the manifest templates.
- Fix this helm chart as I cannot install it. You can use `helm upgrade --install .` to fix the installation.
